djangocms-text-wymeditor
========================

A WYMEditor-based text plugin for django CMS 3

django CMS before version 3.0 included a text editor plugin, with options to use either WYMEditor or TinyMCE.

That has been removed from django CMS 3. Users are now expected to install their own text plugin.

djangocms-text-wymeditor provides a WYMEditor-based text editing plugin, along the lines of 
https://github.com/divio/djangocms-text-ckeditor

In development! Not working!
----------------------------

Plese note that djangocms-text-wymeditor **does not yet** work. 

If you can help get it working, please do.

Alternatives
------------

An alternative would be to use [djangocms_wymeditor_plugin](https://github.com/wymeditor/djangocms_wymeditor_plugin),
which is supported by the WYMeditor organization.
